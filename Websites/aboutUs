        Hello everyone, I'm the founder and CEO of Wheels on Fire&copy;. It's a pleasure to let you get to know me.
        Let’s go through a few notable things about myself, to let you get to know me on a more personal note.
        <br><br>
        <b>1.</b> I was born in Dublin, Ireland on 09/10/1990, making me 35 years old.
        <br><br>
        <b>2.</b> I did an apprenticeship in mechanics when I was 15, then worked as a mechanic for 10 years until I began selling cars and eventually opened my own business.
        <br><br>
        <b>3.</b> Cars are my passion — I take care of them better than my children, if I’m honest. I always make sure they're shiny and perfect before someone comes by to check them out.
        <br><br>
        I hope you were able to get to know me a little better, and please come by Wheels on Fire&copy; — you won't regret it.
      </p>

      <p class="textbox">
        Meet the team at Wheels on Fire&copy;, who are more than happy to assist anyone and everyone who comes through the double doors.
        <br><br>
        Every single person on the team, including the cleaners, are car enthusiasts like myself, and will know everything you might ask about — and more.
        <br><br>
        We are always open to applicants who are car enthusiasts and would like to join our team — just leave your CV at reception and I personally will review it.
        <br><br>
        On behalf of the entire team, we look forward to seeing you at Wheels on Fire&copy; and joining our fiery family, or even working alongside our wonderful crew.
        <br>
        Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">link</a> to a video of the shop where you can get a POV of what it's like.
      </p>

      <p class="textbox">
        Now, why should you come to Wheels on Fire&copy;? Other than the atmosphere, the workers, or even me.
        <br><br>
        Here at Wheels on Fire&copy;, we have the hottest deals — that’s what sets us apart. Our prices are 10% lower than the national average, and our cars are always spotless, with a 100% cashback guarantee if you don't like the car after 1 month.
        <i style="font-size: 7px;">(terms and conditions apply)</i>
        <br><br>
        We also have a 24/7 helpline for any questions you may have, and our customer service has won awards — in 2018, we won Best Customer Service in South Dublin.
        <br><br>
        So head down to Wheels on Fire&copy;, where you'll get the hottest deals on the raddest cars, and join the fiery family!
